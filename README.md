# Infix-to-Postfix
A not-so fleshed-out program that takes a user's mathematical expression into an infix form. Converts the infix into a postfix after

o Prompts the user for a  string of user input.
o Treat that string as a mathematical expression in an infix form.
o Convert the string into a series of tokens where each token is an operator, or a value delimited by whitespace , operator, or \n
o Convert to postfix and print out the results. ( or print out an error if badly formed)  
o Do the math to evaluate the expression when all operands are values ( not variables)
